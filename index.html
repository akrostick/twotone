                <h3>The Wicked Witch of the West</h3>

                

                  <p>Margaret Thatcher was the prime minister of England from 1979 until she 
                  stepped down from office in 1990. Despite having left the house of commons, 
                  she still held a seat in the house of lords, as she was a baroness. Her 
                  leadership of England is considered by a large number of people to have been 
                  cruel and harmful and many of her policies were very controversial. At face 
                  value, Thatcher's policies attempted to lower inflation through privatisation 
                  and free market capitalism. These policies were all grouped into a type of 
                  conservatism, now known as Thatcherism.</p>

                  <p><img src="images/margaret_thatcher.jpg" alt="Margaret Thatcher" width="100%"></p>

                  <p>Magaret Thatcher was a heavily right leaning 
                  conservative with policies that harmed a large group of minorities. She 
                  not only supported the retention of capital punishment and was against 
                  the relaxation of divorce laws, but throughout her time in office, her 
                  socio-economic policies completely destroyed the quality of life for 
                  the working class. She gradually took away power from the trade unions 
                  and instilled policies to make protesting harder by outlawing solidarity 
                  strikes and picketing. She also introduced the homophibic legislation, 
                  Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988. This prohibited counsels 
                  from funding the portrayal of homosexual relationships in all forms of 
                  media and in the education of children. </p>
                    
                  <p>Thatcher was also responsible for The Poll 
                  Tax which most likely directly led to her downfall. The Poll Tax changed 
                  the way tax was calculated from being based on property value, to the number 
                  of people living in the property. It took the effects of taxation off of the 
                  rich and forced it onto poorer families who often had many generations living
                  under the same roof. This single bit of legislation led to some of the worst 
                  and most brutal rioting in British history. Margaret Thatcher may have been 
                  elected democratically, but the working class under Thatcherism were arguably
                  no more worse off than under a fascist regime.</p>

                <h3>Life under Thatcher</h3>
                <p>Life under Thatcher was stark and dismal. Her rise to power 
                  was followed by a brutal widening of social inequality. The proportion of 
                  pensioners living below the poverty line rose from 13%-43% and child poverty 
                  more than doubled. Whereas the rich saw their taxes drop from 83%-40%. 
                  Housing prices skyrocketed under Thatcher, following the Housing Act of 1980.
                  This allowed the tenants of council homes to buy the properties, often below 
                  the market value. This caused a housing boom, resulting in house prices 
                  inflating to over 30% between 1982 and 1989. Meanwhile, rents rose for the 
                  remaining council tenants. By 1991 rent was 55% higher, relative to the 
                  average wage, than it had been ten years ago. </p>
                    
                  
                  <p>Social Housing wasn't the only national 
                  resource that Thatcher's government privatised. Shares were sold  in 
                  numerous national commodities including water, gas, electricity and 
                  telecommunications. This privatisation was done under the guise that it 
                  would give the people more power, but instead it had the inverse effect 
                  as a majority of the shares were bought by big corporations who hiked up 
                  the prices of the commodities. </p>

                  <p>When Thatcher rose to power, unemployment was at 5.7%. The introduction 
                    of spending cuts to education, housing and industry, along with increased 
                    interest rates saw this figure rise sharply. Unemployment passed 3 million 
                    by 1982 and stood at 13%, the highest it had been since the 1930s. Thatcher's
                    battle with the unions, privatisation and the decline in manufacturing investment,
                    resulted in mass welfare dependency. The ramifications of Thatcher'
                    s policies devastated communities in the north and significantly widened 
                    the divide between the rich and the poor.</p>

                <h3>Two Tone and The Specials</h3> 

              </p>

                <p>Two Tone comes out of two very distinct cultures being pushed together 
                  and realising they form a community from shared experience. Both of these 
                  groups were poorer, working class people that were heavily impacted by 
                  Thatcher's socio-economic policies. Many of the songs that come out of Two 
                  Tone are about the struggles that the communities and individuals face, 
                  along with stepping over the boundaries of racial stereotypes. 
                  They effectively took the upbeat elements of Ska and Reggae and fused 
                  them with the power and energy of Punk.

                <p>The Specials were a Two Tone band formed in Coventry, 1977. 
                  Coventry, being the industrial heartland of England, was one of the most 
                  heavily impacted cities by Thatcher's policies. One of their breakthrough 
                  tracks, Ghost Town (1981), was so heavily influential because it perfectly 
                  encapsulated the mood of huge sections of the UK. This is because huge 
                  groups of people could relate the sentiment of the song to their own 
                  experiences. </p>

                  <p>In the second verse of Ghost Town, several points are made about the 
                  state of the country. It asks why youth must fight themselves and how 
                  the government is “leaving the youth on the shelf”. Many people in lower 
                  class families felt that there was no future ahead of them as class divides 
                  were becoming even greater and more disproportionate. The song also states 
                  that there are no jobs in the country, talking about the mass unemployment 
                  caused by Margaret Thatcher's policies.</p>
                  
                  <p>Whilst The Specials were one of the more politicised bands, mostly due this 
                    song, Two Tone bands across the country shared these sentiments as everyone 
                    could relate to the struggles. To quote Ana Tijoux “If you think about The 
                    Specials, they are a response to a very specific moment of crisis: 
                    political, social and economic. When the rage becomes the songs”.</p>

                  <h3>The Two Links</h3>
                  <p>The most helpful rescource by far was the video by the youtube channel Noisey.
                    The reason i found it so useful is because it not only gave me heaps of information on
                    the history of Two Tone, but it also gave me great insight into the lives they were living at the time.
                    The second most helpful was the Guardian article on the right to buy. This Article gave me lots of statistics
                    and information about the housing crisis during the 80s.
